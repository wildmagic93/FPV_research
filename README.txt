This code has been developed for a reasearch project study about floating photovoltaic systems or FPV plant on lakes water:
the logic of the code has been derived from a reasearch paper (at https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12517-021-06674-7)
 that provides a perl code for Solar irradiation on tilted
FPV plants; the code has been converted on Python and modified adding various features in order to determine the maximum
values of Solar irradiance at various tilted angles on different lakes on Sicily, in the southern part of Italy.
The csv files provided as input have been extracted from QGIS software that provided the different geographical coordinates
for the different lakes, the global solar irradiance or GHI and the total solar irradiance DNI across the different months.

The code provides information from one of the lakes listed by selecting one of the string provided in the string list to
the functions resulting irradiance and print results
